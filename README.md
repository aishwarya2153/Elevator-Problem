# Elevator-Problem using reinforcement learning with a tabular TD learning algorithm (Q-learning)

## This project aims to solve the elevator control problem using reinforcement learning with a tabular TD learning algorithm. Specifically, it implements [Q-learning / SARSA] to learn a deterministic policy for optimal elevator control.






# Results
After training, the project generates learning curves (total rewards across episodes) to evaluate the performance of the RL agent.


# Future Work
Incorporate more complex traffic patterns or dynamic passenger arrivals.
Extend the RL algorithm to handle more sophisticated elevator control strategies.
Improve visualization and logging capabilities for better analysis.
